# tensile
Based on a typical stress-strain curve of fibre or fibre-like material (e.g., thread, yarn, and plant root), this package automatically obtain eight mechanical properties of the material. The eight mechanical properies include: yield strain, yield stress, break strain, tensile strength, Youngâ€™s modulus, plastic modulus, plastic strain, and toughness (area below the stress-strain curve, unit: J/m3).

A typical stress-strain curve:
