# tensile
Based on a typical stress-strain curve of fibre or fibre-like material (e.g., thread, yarn, and plant root), this package automatically obtains eight mechanical properties of the material. The eight mechanical properties include yield strain, yield stress, break strain, tensile strength, Youngâ€™s modulus, plastic modulus, plastic strain, and toughness (area below the stress-strain curve, unit: J/m3).

A typical stress-strain curve:
